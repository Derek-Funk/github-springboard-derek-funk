# 1 - Background

## 1.1 - Objective
The first capstone in Springboard's Data Engineering bootcamp was an "open" capstone. Students could use any combination of technologies
to process any big data source of their choosing.

## 1.2 - Topic
I chose to work with the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/), a collection of 1 million songs and related data such
as artists, genres, popularity, etc. My goal was to take all these unstructured data (which were spread across Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) files, SQLite databases, and text files in various directories) into 1 database where all the same data was structured, logically connected, and easily accessible.

## 1.3 - Dataset
There are 3 variations of the Million Song Dataset, which I will abbreviate as MSD going forward:


# 2 - Local Pipeline with BitTorrent and MySQL

# 3 - Cloud Pipeline with AWS S3 and Azure SQL

# 4 - Future Improvements
