THIS README IS NOT YET FINAL...

# 1 - Background

## 1.1 - Objective
The first capstone in Springboard's Data Engineering bootcamp was an "open" capstone. Students could use any combination of technologies
to process any big data source of their choosing.

## 1.2 - Topic
I chose to work with the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/), a collection of 1 million songs and related data such
as artists, genres, popularity, etc. My goal was to process all these unstructured data (which were spread across Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) files, SQLite databases, and text files in various directories) into 1 database where all the same data would be in a new form that was structured, logically connected, and easily accessible.

## 1.3 - Datasets
There are 3 variations of the Million Song Dataset, which I will abbreviate as MSD going forward:
1. Dataset #1 - A subset of the MSD (10,000) available via BitTorrent download
2. Dataset #2 - The same subset available on AWS as an EBS volume
3. Dataset #3 - The full MSD also available as an AWS EBS volume

Dataset #1 (BitTorrent subset) is available


# 2 - Local Pipeline with BitTorrent and MySQL

# 3 - Cloud Pipeline with AWS S3 and Azure SQL

# 4 - Future Improvements
